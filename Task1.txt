Question 1
Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 ?

HTTP1.1

The most recent version of the World Wide Web application protocol, HTTP, which is built on top of the TCP/IP family of Internet protocols, is HTTP 1.1. Web traffic is decreased by HTTP 1.1's faster page delivery than HTTP's predecessor.


HTTP2

A significant update to the HTTP network protocol, which powers the World Wide Web, is HTTP/2. Its origins can be traced back to Google's earlier experimental SPDY protocol. The Internet Engineering Task Force's HTTP Working Group created HTTP/2.

Question 2
Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript ?

An object in JavaScript is a separate entity having properties and a type. Consider comparing it to a cup. A cup is an item with characteristics. A cup has a design, weight, colour, material, and other characteristics. In a similar manner, JavaScript objects can have properties that specify their attributes.

Creating Objects in JavaScript:

1.By object literal
2.By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)

1.By object literal

object ={property1:value1,property2:value2...propertyN:valueN}
syntax
Example:

var person={fname:"Nagaraj", lname:"Gopalakrishnan"}

2.By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword):

syntax
var object =new object()

Example:

var emp=new object()
emp.id=101;
emp.name="Nagaraj Gopalakrishnan";
emp.salary=50000;
